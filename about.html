        <img src="image/unnamed.jpg" style="width: 100%; height:400px" alt="">
        <p class="w3-center">In 2013 we went on a mission in Addis Ababa with the holy blessing of the Rebbe Shlita of
            Lubavitch, the Messianic King .<br />
            Rabbi Eliyahu Habib and Rebbetzin Deborah Leah</p>
            <p class="w3-center w3-padding-32">Embarking on a mission was extremely challenging. We went out with little Moshka, who
                was a year old, to a place empty of Jewish content. And with the help of the name we have
                restored the local community and BH it can be said that now Judaism is thriving here .
                Our activities are extensive, the Chabad House provides an answer in almost every field, we
                have classes, prayers, certifications, an active mikveh, Shabbat and holiday meals. Also,
                kosher food, a kindergarten, a synagogue at the airport, activities on holidays and of course,
                we give Emergency response for anyone who needs it</p>
                <p class="w3-center ">Our activities appeal to the local Jewish community, visitors, embassy staff, Israeli travelers
                    and Jews from around the world </p>
